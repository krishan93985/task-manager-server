Your challenge will be to build a basic task management app. There is a time limit with this challenge, so it’s essential to prioritize the most important features.

## Requirements

Your users should be able to:

Frontend

- Create, read, update, and delete boards and tasks
- There should be frontend form validations when trying to create/edit boards and tasks
- Use state management on frontend (i.e. react hooks)
- Hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Use the optimal responsive layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- You should not use any external component library. Everything should be using react components.
- Visually it should be high fidelity and look similar to the sample screenshot shared above

Backend

- Develop a API using Node.js and Express or graphql (or Next.js API routes)
- Use PostgreSQL as the database and follow good system design principles
- Ensure API endpoints follow proper conventions (e.g., CRUD operations for boards and tasks)
- Implement validation and error handling for API requests
- Use an ORM (i.e knex.js, prisma, objection, etc.) for database interactions
- Optimize database queries for performance and scalability
- Implement logging and monitoring for debugging and analytics

## Not Required

Following features are not required. But if you have time can implement as a bonus

- Allow users to drag and drop tasks to change their status and re-order them in a column
- Being able to add status columns
- Light/Dark Mode
- User authentication
- Don’t worry about tasks vs subtasks.
